Google is working on a next generation Nest Hello Doorbell. On January 5th, [Google confirmed to 9to5Google](https://9to5google.com/2021/01/05/new-google-nest-cam/) that is is working on a “new lineup of security cameras for 2021.” Google released the originial Nest Hello Doorbell in 2018 with a micro USB port. I found this next generation Google Nest Hello Doorbell image which appears to have a USB-C port. Google could announce this next generation doorbell at a Google I/O event if the event isn't cancelled again this year.

Netgear is working on a paid service that will enhance internet connectivity for games. The new service, called Gaming Control Service, will allow users to play online games on faster servers and block ads while playing games. Netgear will offer a trial and special introductory pricing for the new gaming service. Netgear currently offers gaming focused hardware such as the Nighthawk Pro Gaming XR1000 and XR500.

Netgear is also working a new paid service called Business VPN which would either be an offering on top of or in addition to their Insight Cloud offering. Customers will be able to allocate the Business VPN credits to the device where they plan to enable content filtering.

Finally Netgear is still working on a new 'RBR960' Orbi router.

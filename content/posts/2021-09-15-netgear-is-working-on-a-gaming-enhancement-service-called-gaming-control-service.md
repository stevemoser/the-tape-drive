Netgear is working on a paid service that will enhance internet connectivity for games. The new service, called Gaming Control Service, will allow users to play online games on faster servers and block ads while playing games. Netgear will offer a trial and special introductary pricing for the new gaming service. Netgear currently offers gaming focused hardware such as the Nighthawk Pro Gaming XR1000 and XR500.

## Cash Card

Robinhood is working on a new Cash Card with "No monthly fees, in-network ATM fees, overdraft fees, or account minimums." and "Spend, round up, invest your change, and earn a 10-100% bonus each week." I found these images below that show the new design of the card. Also "Round-ups and bonus" are now called "Round-up rewards". 

## Early Payday

Robinhood is also continuting to work on an early payday feature for direct deposits. Robinhood will use Atomic FI for setting up direct deposits.

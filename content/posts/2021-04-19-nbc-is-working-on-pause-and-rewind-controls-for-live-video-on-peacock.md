NBC is adding controls to pause and rewind live video on its video streaming service Peacock. Additionally users will be able to skip back 10 seconds or jump back to the real time video stream. The ability to pause live video is one of the biggest missing features of the NBC's Peacock service especially as it has added more live sports and WWE content where users are used to pausing live video. I expect this feature to go live before July 23 which is the start of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Summer Games.

NBC is also looking to revamp their offering for children. The new offering will be called 'Peacock Kids'.

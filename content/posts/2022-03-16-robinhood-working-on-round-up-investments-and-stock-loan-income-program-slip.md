I found code in Robinhood's iOS app that implies Robinhood is working on a Margin Withdrawal feature.

Robinhood is also working on a Stock Loan Income Program (SLIP) feature where users will be able to "potentially earn extra income when we lend out stocks you already own."

> Through SLIP, you have the opportunitiy to earn passive income by lending whole shares of stocks to other institutions. These

> institutions may borrow stocks to settle trades or facilitate short sales. You'll be able to buy and sell as usual, even if your stocks are on loan. Note: while
>
> you have a margin balance, your shares will not be eligible to be loaned out.

 If users elect to use the SLIP feature then they forgo voting on proposals like board of directors appointments.

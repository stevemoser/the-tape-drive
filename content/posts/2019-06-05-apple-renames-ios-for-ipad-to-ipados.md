  Program License Agreement (accessibile only if you have a developer
  membership) was uploaded to Apple's developer site with a timestamp of June
  3rd 2019. Major changes were found when comparing it to the previous license
  agreement (October 10th 2018). The biggest change was the addition of

Hours before Apple kicked off this year's WWDC keynote a [new Apple Developer Program License Agreement](https://download.developer.apple.com/Documentation/Apple_Developer_Program_License_Agreement/Apple_Developer_Program_License_Agreement_20190603.pdf) (accessibile only if you have a developer membership) was uploaded to Apple's developer site with a timestamp of June 3rd 2019. Major changes were found when comparing it to the previous license agreement (October 10th 2018). The biggest change was the addition of as-yet-unannounced iPadOS to the list of operating systems that they support. 

![iPadOS in Apple Developer Program License Agreement]( "iPadOS in Apple Developer Program License Agreement")

To be clear this is a marketing change and rename of the existing iOS for iPad, not a brand new OS from the ground up.

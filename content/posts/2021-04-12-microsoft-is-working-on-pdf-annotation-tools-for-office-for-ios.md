Microsoft is adding new PDF related features to Office for iOS. A new feature to merge PDFs will require an internet connection. Microsoft is also working on the ability for users to markup PDFs with bookmarks, annotations, and add signatures from users' photo library. Microsoft is using Google's [PDFium](https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/) library to enable these PDF realted features.

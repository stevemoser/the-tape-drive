## Google Goals

Google is working on a new feature for tracking habits, skills, exercise, activities, or goals. The codename for the new feature is Timely. Some examples that Google suggests as goals and related strings are included below.

## Navigate to meeting rooms

Google is also working on a feature to help users locate and navigate their way to meeting rooms. Users will have to install a shortcut to enable this feature. It is not clear if this feature will use augmented realtiy but Google has enable indoor directions in the past for malls.

## Encrypted Events and Attachments

Google is also working on encrypted meeting invites or events. Encrypted events encrypt the contents of the event so users will not be able to attach encrypted files to an encrypted event. Users will also be able to change the visibility of events to not only Public or Private but also Confidential.

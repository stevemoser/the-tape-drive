Square is working on expanding POS availability to Spain. Code in Square's app reveals references to Spain, options for inputing a user's providence to support Spain addresses, and slight changes to processing VAT for transactions. Currently Square supports card payments in the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. And [earlier this summer](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-announces-early-access-programme-france) Square announced that they will support card payments in France soon.

Square is also continuing to work on an updated Square Stand that supports the latest iPads and offers integrated tap-to-pay and chip reader payment options.

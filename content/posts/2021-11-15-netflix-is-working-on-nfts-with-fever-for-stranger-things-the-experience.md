Details inside of Fever's iOS app reveal that they are working on NFTs for Netflix's [Stranger Things: The Experience](https://feverup.com/m/100756) or the [Strange Things: The Official Store](https://strangerthings-store.com). The event will take place in New York City in May 2022 and is described by Fever as "Write your story as you journey through a fun gathering of iconic locations and fan-favorite moments, enjoying one-of-a-kind photo ops and uncovering plenty of thrills along the way. There may also be the occasional testing, analysis, or psych evaluation."

Fever's iOS app will let users "Collect the cards and claim your gifts". In order for customers to claim their NFT they must validate their reward with staff. Part of that process will include telling the user to "Trace the V to validate your tickets."

NFTs attached to ticketed events have become more popular as [Livenation recently announced](https://www.livenationentertainment.com/2021/10/live-nation-unveils-live-stubs-digital-collectible-nft-ticket-stubs-minting-first-ever-set-for-the-swedish-house-mafia-paradise-again-tour/) their support for NFTs.

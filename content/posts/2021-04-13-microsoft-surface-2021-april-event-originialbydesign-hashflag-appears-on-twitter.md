The hashflag image depicts 4 gray emoji faces. [Jane Wong's hashflag browser](https://wongmjane.com/hashflag-browser) shows the filename for the hashflag is Surface_OriginalByDesign_April_2021 which indicates the event will take place in April and will feature a new Surface device. Also the hashflag browser shows that the event hashflag will appear on Twitter from 2021-04-13 - 2021-07-14. Microsoft could send out invite for this event as soon as today.

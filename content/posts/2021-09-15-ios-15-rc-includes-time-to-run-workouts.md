Yesterday Apple released iOS 15 RC to developers. References to 'Time to Run' are included in the iOS 15 RC. Similar to 'Time to Walk', 'Time to Run' would presumedly allow Apple Fitness+ subscribers to download and listen to guided running workouts on their Apple Watch. The reference reads:

> Time to Run Workouts are downloaded when Apple Watch is connect to power and near your iPhone. Completed workouts are deleted automatically.

The possibility of 'Time to Run' workout being included in iOS 15 and watchOS 8 was first suggested by Mark Gurman in his [August 15 PowerOn newsletter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-15/what-s-new-about-the-next-apple-aapl-iphone-airpods-and-macs-ksdike4t). Currently iOS 15 RC doesn't show any available 'Time to Run' workouts as the feature will most likely launch after iOS 15 is released publically.

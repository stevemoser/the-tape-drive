Sonos has been working on their own voice assistant since at least November 20th, 2019 when they [acquired Snips](https://investors.sonos.com/news-and-events/investor-news/latest-news/2019/Sonos-Announces-Acquisition-of-Snips/default.aspx). Snips was a privacy focused voice assistant that processed queries offline. The branding for the Sonos voice assistant, simply known as Sonos Voice Control, is smiliar to Amazon Alexa's voice bubble branding but reversed and it contains a black and white bullseye. Also it seems that Sonos will allow its voice assistant to be active while Amazon's Alexa is also active. However Sonos will not allow Google's voice assitant to be active with any other voice assistant. Or rather, Sonos executives claim that Google doesn't allows its assistant to work side-by-side with any competing assistants from Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, or Baidu.

PayPal is working on renaming its Honey Gold cashback rewards program to PayPal Gold. PayPal acquired Honey Science Corporation in January 2020 for $4 billion. Honey, a shopping rewards program, is now called Honey by PayPal. Honey helps users find promo codes to save money on 3rd party shopping websites. PayPal will also offer the PayPal Gold service in its mobile apps. PayPal Gold will suppliment PayPal's existing [shopping deals portal](https://www.paypal.com/shopping/).

PayPay is also working on a feature to provide easy returns for users via scanning a QR code on shipped packages.

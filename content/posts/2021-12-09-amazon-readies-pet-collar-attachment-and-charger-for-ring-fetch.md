I reported on a [higher resolution image and details ](https://thetapedrive.com/amazon-plans-to-release-a-suite-of-ring-product-including-amazon-fetch-ring-auto-and-this-strange-looking-jaws-camera)on what might be called Amazon Fetch or Ring Fetch back in June. Amazon originally announced the Ring Fetch in 2019 as a pet tracker. Amazon has not released the product for purchase at the time of writing. I uncovered a video that details how the tracker attaches to pet collars and how it charges. The Ring Fetch can be used with a cover and elastic band accessory so that it can be attached to existing pet collars. The bottom of the Ring Fetch appears to have a QR code and 3 electical contact points for connecting to a charging cradle.

Besides finding references to Apple's as-yet-unannounced Tile-like 'Tag1,1' I also found an ARKit 'star' icon in the new Find My app. Apple's new Find My app in iOS 13 replaces both the Find my iPhone and Find my Friends app. The ARKit 'star' icon included in the Find My app implies that there might be a way to use augmented reality to find lost devices. Curiously there is also a circular Settings icon which could imply that this app could run on the watch or as-yet-unannounced hardware. Finally why did Apple include an orange balloon in the app?

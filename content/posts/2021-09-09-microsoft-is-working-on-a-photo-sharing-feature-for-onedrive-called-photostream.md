Microsoft is working on a photo sharing feature called Photostream. Photostream will be backed by Microsoft's OneDrive service. The Photostream feature is intended to be a way to share photos privately with family and friends. Users will be able to attach photos to 'Stories' that will have different permissions for different social groups. Users must be invited to Stories to see shared photos. Microsoft will not monetize Photostream with ads.

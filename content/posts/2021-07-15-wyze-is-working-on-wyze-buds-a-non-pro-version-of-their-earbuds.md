Wyze is working on a new set of headphones they call Wyze Buds. Wyze has already released a set of pro earbuds that feature active noise cancellation (ANC). Presumedly these non-pro Wyze Buds will not include ANC. The unreleased Wyze Buds feature a stem-less design unlike the pro version and more like Apple's new Beats Studio Buds. The Wyze Buds will feature tap gesture to control playback and a battery case with interior and exterior status ligths.

Remember Tumblr? It seems they are working on a tipping feature. I found references to 'Enable Tip Jar to start accepting tips' and 'Your personal and deposit details have been verified' in their iOS app. There is also what appears to be a low resolution version of the cash with wings emoji ðŸ’¸.

Tumblr also appears to be working with Stripe on their tipping feature as another reference reads   "To enable your Tip Jar weâ€™re going to direct you to our payment partner, Stripe so you can safely provide your personal and deposit details to get paid. Donâ€™t worry, weâ€™ll bring you back here when your done."

It isn't clear if 100% of the tip goes to the creator but it probably safe to assume that it does because otherwise Apple wouldn't allow the app in their App Store.

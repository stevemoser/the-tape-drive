Amazon is launching their Packaging-Free Delivery (PFD) to the United States soon. [Amazon has been expanding](https://www.aboutamazon.in/news/operations/amazon-india-expands-packaging-free-shipping-to-more-than-100-cities) their Packaging-Free Delivery option to more cities in India recently where it is called Packaging-Free Shipping (PFS) instead of Packaging-Free Delivery (PFD):

> Amazon had first launched PFS in India in June 2019 in 9 cities and within a year, the company has been able to successfully expand this program to more than 100 cities.
>
> With this expansion of PFS, more than 40% of Amazon customer orders shipped from Amazon Indiaâ€™s Fulfilment centers are now packaging-free or have significantly reduced packaging. With PFS, multiple customer orders are secured and transported in re-usable totes during deliveries.

Packaging-Free Delivery will be offered for free in the beginning. Then after May 31, 2022 Amazon will charge customers $1.99 per order to use Packaging-Free Delivery. PFD will be part of the Amazon Key delivery service.

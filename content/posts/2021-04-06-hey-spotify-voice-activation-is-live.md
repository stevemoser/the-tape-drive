A few days ago I [posted images of Spotify's Car Thing ](https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1378033575417815041?s=20)device, UI, and mounting options. Now Spotify's voice activations feature is live. As the feature rolls out users will receive a notification from Spotify stating "Just enable your mic and say, 'Hey Spotify, Play my Favorite Songs'. Try it and see what songs we've got for you!" Upon opening the notification users are prompted to enable microphone access which states "This lets you control Spotify using your voice." Finally just use the hot word "Hey Spotify" to trigger the voice assistant. The voice assistant offers basic music controls and the ability to queue up songs, artists, or albums. In Spotify's settings under 'Voice Interactions' user can toggle the "Hey Spotify" functionality, view terms & conditions, and choose between two voices. Alternatively users can hold down the search button to bring up the [Spotify Voice](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/spotify-voice/) UI.

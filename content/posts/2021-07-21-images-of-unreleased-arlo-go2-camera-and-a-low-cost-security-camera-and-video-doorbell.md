## Unreleased Arlo Camera

Arlo is planning to release an undated version of their 720p LTE Arlo Go security camera. The new camera, currently called the Arlo Go2, will feature 1080p and wifi in addition to LTE.

Arlo is also preparing to launch a low cost doorbell and security camera. The marketing names have not yet been revealed. Interestingly both cameras feature what look like AA batteries instead of Arlo's proprietary batteries for the first time.

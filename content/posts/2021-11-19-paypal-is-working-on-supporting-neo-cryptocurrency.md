PayPal is working on a feature to allow [merchants to accept cryptocurrencies](https://twitter.com/deitaone/status/1461447480281812992?s=21). Currently PayPal supports Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). However images hidden in the PayPal Business iOS app indicate that PayPal will soon support paying merchants with Neo (NEO).

Neo (formally Antshares) is cryptocurrency and smart contract platform created in 2014. Neo is in the middle of upgrading to a new version of the Neo protocol called Neo N3. N3 supports new features such as platform native decentralized storage, a name service, and oracles.

PayPal will be the first fintech 'super app' to support Neo as currently Robinhood, Square, and Coinbase do not support buying, selling, or trading Neo.

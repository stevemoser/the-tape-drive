I found code in WhatsApp that indicates that Meta (formally: Facebook) is working on verifying Novi users' bank accounts using Klarna. The code reads "Novi uses Klarna to instanstly verify your bank account and to make sure you have enough money in your bank to complete transactions", "Bank verification with Klarna", and "We need you to go to the Novi app to upload a valid bank statement." Meta launched the Novi app last fall. Klarna is a popular Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) payments company.

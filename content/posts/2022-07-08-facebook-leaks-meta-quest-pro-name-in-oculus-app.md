I found references to 'Meta Quest Pro' in Facebook's Oculus mobile app. Many speculated that Meta might name their next gen VR headrest 'Quest 2 Pro' but the code references confirm that currently Meta is going with the 'Meta Quest Pro' name that is rumored to cost more than $800 or $1000.

I also found references to 'Eye Tracking Support' in the code which confirms that the long rumored feature is coming to the Meta Quest Pro. Also back in June I confirmed that the [Meta Quest Pro will come with a dock](https://www.thetapedrive.com/p/references-to-as-yet-unannounced?utm_source=twitter&sd=fs) and the next version of[ Meta Avatars will have legs](https://twitter.com/stevemoser/status/1524761755884433410?s=21).

TikTok is working on changes for their Live Events feature. Notably that TikTok creators can be given event violations. The TikTok app will tell creators who end their live events too early: "Your event ended shortly after going after the start time, resulting in an event violation. Multiple LIVE violations can result in limited feature access for future LIVE events." TikTok will give creators the ability to block, mute, and reply to comments during live events. Viewers of live events will be register for future live events and translate comments with a touch of a button next to comments.

Evidence hidden inside of PayPal's iOS app has revealed that PayPal is working on a coin called "PayPal Coin". When Bloomberg reached out to PayPal about it PayPal responded that they are working on a USD stable. A stable coin is a cryptocurrency that is pegged to a more stable currency. The PayPal Coin logo looks like PayPal's logo but with two horizontal lines through it.
